This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

GOALS:
- build to do app with SQLite DB to store todos

NOTES:
- favicons don't work if you're viewing from `localhost`. Viewing from remote works.

TODO:
- explore `hono` for Express-like syntax
- explore `bun:sqlite`
- explore websockets with bun
